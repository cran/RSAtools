Description: Provides tools for response surface analysis, using a comparative framework that identifies best-fitting solutions across 37 families of polynomials. Many of these tools are based upon and extend the 'RSA' package, by testing a larger scope of polynomials (+27 families), more diverse response surface probing techniques (+acceleration points), more plots (+line of congruence, +line of incongruence, both with extrema), and other useful functions for exporting results.
